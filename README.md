Kubernetes Hacks!
=================

This repository is a junk drawer filled with half-baked Kubernetes
ideas, weird containers for exploring the functionality of k8s
(and possibly other container orchestrators), etc.

Please don't run any of this in production.

Contributions are not accepted.  See above note about running this
junk in production.
